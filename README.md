# ultimate-TTT
A Java-based "Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe" game - tic-tac-toe where each cell of the main board contains another, smaller board. To win the game, you have to win three of the smaller boards in a row.

This twist adds complexity to an otherwise trivial game, making it much more fun and interesting to play. Try it out using the included, self-contained .jar executable.
