# ultimate-TTT
A Java-based "Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe" game - tic-tac-toe where each cell of the main board contains another, smaller board. To win the game, you have to win three of the smaller boards in a row. This twist adds complexity to an otherwise trivial game, making it much more fun and interesting to play. 

The latest commits include the addition of an AI that you can play against. The AI uses the minimax search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to minimize the search space. It performs very well, and is pretty fun to play against! Try it out using the included, self-contained .jar executable.
